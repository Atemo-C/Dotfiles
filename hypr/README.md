# Hyprland and Hyprpaper configuration
Configuration files for:
- [The Hyprland Wayland compositor](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland)
- [The Hyprpaper wallpapar utility for Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprpaper).

### Split Hyprland configuration
This configuration is split into various configuration files, all sourced in `hyprland.conf`. The split mostly follows Hyprland's own setting sections, and is done in a semi-similar way to how my [NixOS configuration](https://github.com/Atemo-C/NixOS-Configuration) is split.

### Screen shaders for Hyprland
Optional CRT-like shaders, modfiied from [these](https://github.com/Euro20179/.files/blob/master/.config/hypr/shaders/crt.frag) to not round the screen and to have more/thinner lines. I mostly use them with some retro games or ones with minimalist appearance that benefit from the look. Quite niche, indeed.

### Hyprpaper
Managed by [my simple wallpaper script](https://github.com/Atemo-C/Scripts/blob/main/Desktop%20scripts/Hyprpaper.sh).
