# Atemo Cajaku's dotfiles
Greetings. Here, one can find a few of the configuration files for various programs that I use on my personal computers.
Though, since most things have been moved to [my NixOS configuration](https://github.com/Atemo-C/NixOS-configuration), there probably will not be much here anymore. Keeping this repostory for a few months in case I do end up putting things back here.
