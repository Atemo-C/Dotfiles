# Alacritty configuration

This is a configuration from scratch for [the Alacritty terminal emulator](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty).

---

### Colours
Background, foreground, dim, normal, and bright colours have all been manually assigned for the best results.

### Fonts
Currently, the [Ubuntu](https://design.ubuntu.com/font) Mono [Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) is used. I am looking for a way to make every emoji appear properly, so that I may fully switch from LXTerminal to Alacritty. Suggestions are welcome.

### Opacity
`0.8` for a slightly transparent background whilst retaining a great amount of visiblity.
